	<h1>Welcome to the Online Dispute Resolution Study!</h1>

</head>

<body> 

	<p>
	This study is intended to test a new service called <i>EZSettle</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
	You and another participant will each be playing the role of a person who has been involved in
	an e-commerce transaction in which something has gone wrong. You were randomly assigned
	to the role of either the buyer or the seller in the transaction. You will receive a fact sheet that
	describes your side of the story to provide you with information for attempting to resolve the
	dispute that emerged.
	</p>
	<p>
	After you have each read your role, you will be asked to enter the EZSettle website. EZSettle is
	a new service for resolving disputes online. The instructions for the EZSettle process are detailed
	on the EZSettle website. It is essential that you read the instructions thoroughly.
	</p>
	<p>
	After resolving the dispute using EZSettle, we will ask you to give us feedback on the process by
	asking you some questions about your experience.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Read the fact sheet</li>
		<li>Use EZSettle</li>
		<li>Fill out the feedback questionnaire</li>
	<ol>

			To simulate a real case, we ask that you carefully read the fact sheet. You should use EZSettle in
			the same way you would have used it had you found yourself in the described situation in real
			life.
