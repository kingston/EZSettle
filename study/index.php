	<p>In this study, you and another participant will each be asked to play the role of a person who has been involved in a transaction online in which something has gone wrong. Each one of you has been randomly assigned to the role of either the buyer or the seller in the transaction, and you will receive a fact sheet describing your respective stories. The fact sheet will describe what has happened and will provide you with the necessary information for the resolution of the dispute. After you have read your role, we will ask you to attempt to resolve the case using a new system of online dispute resolution that we are testing: EZSettle.com.  On the EZSettle website you will find explanations about how the system works. In order to simulate a real case, we provide you with some general information about your side of the story. We ask that you will use this information in the same way you would have used it had you found yourself in such a situation in real life. After you complete the process using EZSettle.com, we will ask you to give us feedback on the system and will ask you some questions about your experience. In total, the study has 3 parts: fill personal data, go to website of system, and fill feedback.
