	<h2> Basic Info </h2>

</head>

<body>  Your old laptop broke down the week before exams. A friend told you about the almost brand new laptop he bought for a great price from a seller who posted a sales listing on PC4U.com (an “e-bay” for PCs). It sounded like a great idea, and after browsing the PC4U.com website, you found a sales listing for a “like new” laptop that met your needs, for the price of $1000. Pleased, you purchased the laptop from the seller, using your credit card. Since you needed the laptop immediately you paid additional $20 for one day shipment. The package arrived the next day. When you took the laptop out of the box, you noticed that the screen was cracked and a few keyboard keys were loose. You contacted PC4U.com to complain about the condition of the laptop, and PC4U.com invited you to use their standard dispute resolution process, to which the seller also consented.  When you contacted PC4U.com, you did not mention two facts:
<ul>
	<li> You saw the delivery man carry the box to your house, and he seemed somewhat rough with it. You are not sure whether this could have caused any damage to the screen or keyboard, but it seems quite unlikely.  </li>

	<li> Your friend Gabe offered to buy the laptop from you for $500 (Gabe builds things out of computer parts, and does not care that much about the cracked screen)  </li>
</ul>At your discretion, you may or may not decide to share this additional information with the mediator and/or the other party.

<h2>What do you want to get out of the dispute resolution process?</h2>

<ul>	<li>It seems unfair that you’ll be stuck with a computer you can’t really use, and you are annoyed you wasted your money on expedited shipping. You want to return the laptop to the seller and be refunded the full cost of the laptop ($1000) and shipping ($20). </li>	<li>Your uncle, who is a lawyer, said you are entitled for compensation for the emotional and financial damage you suffered due to not having a working laptop for exams.</li>	<ul>
		<li>o	You had to rent a laptop for exams, costing $150, which was stressful and annoying. You feel it is only fair that the seller will bear this cost.</li>		<li>o	Your uncle says that you are entitled for compensation for the emotional distress you suffered. He estimates the standard compensation in such circumstances at $150.  You are not sure how it is calculated, but you do feel the seller should pay something for making you go through this nightmare during exam period. </li>
	</ul>
</ul> 

<h2>Here's a summary of the topics you need to address and your expenses:</h2>

Laptop - $1000 <br>Expedited Shipping - $20 <br>Rental of replacement laptop - $150 <br>Emotional distress (your uncle's estimate) - $150 <br>Total - $1320
