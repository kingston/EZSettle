	</div></li>
	
	<li><div class="loud q" id="3"><span id="arrow3"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span> When can I access the system?</div>
		<div class="quiet box hide" id="a3">Anytime. The EZSettle system is always accessible.</div></li>
	
	<li><div class="loud q" id="4"><span id="arrow4"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span> From where can I access the system?</div>
	<div class="quiet box hide" id="a4">Anywhere. If you have an internet connection, you can access the EZSettle system. EZSettle is compatible with every modern (HTML5 compliant) web browser.</div></li>
	
			<li><div class="loud q" id="5"><span id="arrow5"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span> What is a “Claimant”?</div>
	<div class="quiet box hide" id="a5">The Claimant is the party initiating the case. The Claimant may be either a buyer or a seller.</div></li>
	
		<li><div class="loud q" id="6"><span id="arrow6"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span> What is a "Respondent"</div>
	<div class="quiet box hide" id="a6">The Respondent is the party responding to the case. The Respondent may be either a buyer or a seller.</div></li>
	
	<li><div class="loud q" id="7"><span id="arrow7"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span> Can EZSettle generate efficient solutions?</div>
	<div class="quiet box hide" id="a7">The EZSettle process is structured to help the parties to gain better understanding of their interests and the options for resolving their dispute in a consensual mediation process. If agreement is not reached, EZSettles helps the parties reach a fair and professional final settlement in arbitration. EZSettle’s preference analysis tools know exactly how both parties value the multiple issues that comprise every dispute. EZSettle takes that knowledge and uses the sophisticated optimization algorithms of the AnaLegal computational system to generate solutions that maximize satisfaction for both parties.</div></li>

	<li><div class="loud q" id="8"><span id="arrow8"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span> What is mediation?</div>
	<div class="quiet box hide" id="a8">Mediation is a way of resolving disputes between two parties through the use of a third party facilitator (termed a mediator). The purpose of the mediator is to structure the negotiation between the two parties with the intent of reaching a mutually acceptable resolution. Mediation is not a legally binding process.</div></li>
	
	<li><div class="loud q" id="9"><span id="arrow9"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span> What is arbitration?</div>
	<div class="quiet box hide" id="a9">Arbitration is a legal technique for the resolution of disputes outside the courts, wherein two parties to a dispute refer it to a third party (termed an arbitrator) for a decision. Arbitration is a legally binding procedure, and the arbitrator’s decision must be complied with.</div></li>
	
	<li><div class="loud q" id="10"><span id="arrow10"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span> Does EZSettle require a party to reveal preference information to another party?</div>
	<div class="quiet box hide" id="a10">No. What and how much is revealed is completely under each party’s own control. Confidential information revealed to the mediator will be treated as such and will not be revealed to the other party.</div></li>
	
		<li><div class="loud q" id="11"><span id="arrow11"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span> What are some resolution options?</div>
	<div class="quiet box hide" id="a11">Every case is different and so some solutions may be better fits than others. Here are some options and ideas that have worked for other cases: 
		<ul>
			<li>Return of the item to the seller</li>
			<li>Delivery of the item to the buyer</li>
			<li>Repair of the item</li>
			<li>Reimbursement of some or all expenses related to repair</li>
			<li>Reimbursement of some or all expenses related to pickup/delivery</li>

			<li>Compensation through additional warranty coverage</li>
			<li>Financial compensation</li> 
			<li>Apology</li>
			<li>A combination of some of the above options</li>
		</ul>
	</div></li>
	
	<li><div class="loud q" id="12"><span id="arrow12"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span>What happens if no agreement is reached?</div>

	<li><div class="loud q" id="13"><span id="arrow13"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span> Can I retract an offer after I submit it?</div>
	<div class="quiet box hide" id="a13">No. Once an offer is made in the EZSettle system, it is considered a legal contract.</div></li>

	<li><div class="loud q" id="14"><span id="arrow14"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span> Are EZSettle transactions secure?</div>
	<div class="quiet box hide" id="a14">EZSettle currently employs the widely used OpenSSL protocol with the 168-bit triple-DES encryption algorithm to provide state of the art security for your online dispute resolution needs.</div></li>

	<li><div class="loud q" id="15"><span id="arrow15"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/> Do I have to accept one of the other party’s offers?</span></div>
	<div class="quiet box hide" id="a15">No. You are not required to accept any of the other party’s offers during the mediation stage. However, if no agreement is reached the case will proceed to binding arbitration.</div></li>

	<li><div class="loud q" id="16"><span id="arrow16"><img src="images/arrow_closed.png"/></span> Is EZSettle really a neutral party?</div>
	<div class="quiet box hide" id="a16">EZSettle is private and independent. It is not an agent or representative of any sponsor or party using the system.</div></li>
