	Your privacy is important to EZSettle. We limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum required to deliver superior service to our customers, which includes advising them about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business. We do not reveal customer information to external organizations unless we have previously informed the customer in disclosures or agreements, have been authorized by the customer, or are required by law.
<hr class="space"/>
	We permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our Privacy Policy are subject to an effective disciplinary process.
	If a facilitator is involved in the negotiation, privacy of the information to which the facilitator is given access, is governed by a separate agreement signed prior to beginning the process. The recommended form to be used by EZSettle facilitators is available upon request.
<hr class="space"/>
	Private information entered into the system during negotiation is always under the control of the user and is accessible only by those to whom the user gives the access codes. Users can delete their private party information at any time. Except as otherwise decided by the negotiating parties, all decisions reached with EZSettle will be kept confidential.
