	<p>Dear Pat128 and Casey345, thank you for joining the EZSettle process. {if $condition == 1 || $condition == 2 || $condition == 5}The EZSettle software is{else}I will be your mediator, and I'm{/if} here to help you solve this case. {$condition==1||$condition==2||$condition=5}Here is a quick explanation on{else}Let me first quickly explain{/if} how our process works. We begin with trying to reach agreement in mediation. Each one of you can make up to 3 settlement offers that the other party can accept or reject. Throughout the process, {$condition==1||$condition==2||$condition=5}the system{else}I{/if} will communicate with you separately. Any information you share with me remains completely confidential. If you would like {$condition==1||$condition==2||$condition=5}the system{else}me{/if} to share particular information with the other party, you may do so by using the chat box titled “share message with other party”. Let’s keep it civil, please respect each other and avoid using foul language.</p>

	<p>As you will be making offers, {$condition==1||$condition==2||$condition=5}the system{else}I{/if} will make suggestions that will help you reach an agreement. If after 3 offers and counter offers you will not reach an agreement, you will be transferred to the EZSettle arbitration process, where {if $condition==1||$condition==3}you will receive a binding settlement from the EZSettle professional AnaLegal arbitration software{elseif $condition==2||$condition==4}you will receive a binding settlement from an EZSettle professionally trained arbitrator{else}you will be asked to choose receiving a binding settlement from either the EZSettle professional AnaLegal arbitration software or one of our professional trained arbitrators{/if}. This settlement will be based on the information we received from both parties.</p>

	<p>Some people reach mutual agreement in mediation; others choose to decline the last offer and move to arbitration. When people think that the arbitrator will give them a better settlement than the last offer of their counter party, they often choose to proceed to arbitration.</p>

	<p>We will start the process today by having each one of you confirm the issues at hand, then we will ask you to determine the importance of each issue to you, and finally we will ask you to make offers. It is customary to let the complainant in the case make the first offer, so in your case Pat128 will be asked to make the first offer.</p>
